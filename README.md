# TRIPLE AMAZING — Placeholder Site

This is a minimal **work-in-progress landing page** for tripleamazing.com.  
It’s a single static HTML file styled with Tailwind CSS (via CDN).

---

## Files
- `index.html` — the site itself

---

## How to Use

### 1. Local Preview
Simply open `index.html` in your browser — no build step needed.

### 2. Deployment Options

#### Option A: Upload Directly to Hosting
- If your domain provider supports static hosting (e.g., Namecheap, Bluehost, GoDaddy), upload `index.html` to the root of your site.

#### Option B: GitHub + Vercel/Netlify (recommended)
1. Create a new GitHub repository and add the `index.html` file.
2. Connect the repo to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
3. Deploy with one click — free tiers are perfect for this placeholder.
4. Point your domain `tripleamazing.com` to the deployed site.

#### Option C: Basic Server
- Place `index.html` in your server’s root (e.g., `/var/www/html/`) and reload Nginx/Apache.

---

## Customization
- **Email:** currently set to `hello@tripleamazing.com` — change the `mailto:` links if needed.
- **Socials:** Instagram links included for `@triple.amazing` and `@staytripleamazing`.
- **Styling:** edit inline Tailwind classes inside `index.html` to tweak colors, spacing, or typography.

---

## Notes
- Uses Tailwind via CDN — no build process required.
- Fully responsive and mobile-friendly.
- Text and glow animations are powered by Tailwind utility classes.
